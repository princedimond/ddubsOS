# ddubos Deep Analysis — 2025-09-06

This report reviews your NixOS + Home Manager repository at /home/dwilliams/ddubsos for structure, Home Manager integration, and adherence to common/best practices. It also gives concrete recommendations and optional refactors.

## Executive summary
- You are using flakes correctly with pinned inputs (flake.lock present) and clean module factoring under modules/ and hosts/.
- Home Manager is integrated as a NixOS module (recommended pattern), with the user’s home imported from modules/home via a default.nix aggregator. This is idiomatic.
- Using default.nix (as a directory index) inside modules/home is normal; renaming to home.nix is not necessary unless you prefer that naming. home.nix is more common in single-file HM setups; default.nix is conventional for a directory aggregator.
- The biggest structural improvement opportunity is parameterizing host per configuration in flake.nix (instead of a single host = "ixas" used for all outputs), so each nixosConfigurations.<name> uses the matching hosts/<name>/ variables.
- Overall the project follows many good practices: stateVersion pinned for both system and home, inputs follow nixpkgs where appropriate, overlays collected in one place, and flatpak integration via nix-flatpak.

## Repository layout (key parts observed)
- flakes: flake.nix, flake.lock
- hosts/<host>/: hardware.nix, host-packages.nix, variables.nix, default.nix
- modules/core/: system.nix, user.nix, overlays.nix, boot.nix, services.nix, etc.
- modules/home/: default.nix aggregator with GUI, shells, editors, hyprland, terminals, etc.
- profiles/: gpu profile families (amd, intel, nvidia, vm)
- pkgs/: custom packages (e.g., pkgs/twin)
- docs/: extensive documentation

Evidence snippets:
```nix path=/home/dwilliams/ddubsos/flake.nix start=16
  inputs = {
    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
```

Home Manager integrated via NixOS module and your home imported from modules/home:
```nix path=/home/dwilliams/ddubsos/modules/core/user.nix start=12
  imports = [ inputs.home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager ];
  home-manager = {
    useUserPackages = true;
    useGlobalPkgs = false;
    backupFileExtension = "backup";
    extraSpecialArgs = { inherit inputs username host profile; };
    users.${username} = {
      imports = [
        ./../home
        inputs.catppuccin.homeModules.catppuccin
      ];
      home = {
        username = "${username}";
        homeDirectory = "/home/${username}";
        stateVersion = "25.05";
      };
      programs.home-manager.enable = true;
```

System stateVersion is pinned (good):
```nix path=/home/dwilliams/ddubsos/modules/core/system.nix start=40
  powerManagement = {
    enable = true; # Ensure power management is enabled
    cpuFreqGovernor = "performance"; # Set the governor to performance
  };

  console.keyMap = "${consoleKeyMap}";
  system.stateVersion = "25.05"; # Do not change!
}
```

## Home Manager: default.nix vs home.nix
- Your modules/home/default.nix acts as a directory index and composes many submodules. This is an idiomatic pattern for multi-file HM setups. There is no need to rename this file to home.nix unless you prefer that style.
- home.nix is commonly seen when Home Manager is configured as a single file (standalone HM) or in very small setups. For modular directories, default.nix is the conventional aggregator filename.
- Conclusion: Staying with default.nix here is aligned with common practice.

## How Home Manager is integrated
- Integration method: NixOS module through inputs.home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager (recommended).
- Your user home configuration is pulled from modules/home via imports, with extraSpecialArgs exposing inputs, username, host, profile. This is clean and flexible.
- useUserPackages = true and useGlobalPkgs = false: This isolates HM’s package set from the system. Trade-off:
  - Pros: Avoids accidental coupling with system pkgs; clearer boundaries.
  - Cons: Builds can be duplicated across system/home; larger closure if the same packages appear both sides. If you value build reuse and speed, consider useGlobalPkgs = true; otherwise, keeping it false is perfectly acceptable and is a common choice.

## NixOS configuration architecture
- You factor common system modules under modules/core and per-host toggles under hosts/<host>/variables.nix. That’s a healthy separation of responsibilities.
- Profiles under profiles/ (amd, intel, nvidia, vm) are wired into the NixOS system via mkNixosConfig gpuProfile: good for GPU-specific differences.
- Opportunity: In flake.nix, host is hard-coded to "ixas" and passed via specialArgs to every nixosConfigurations.<name>. That means all configurations will use the ixas host variables and not their own. Consider changing nixosConfigurations to also vary host.

Current mkNixosConfig excerpt (note host in specialArgs is a flake-level constant):
```nix path=/home/dwilliams/ddubsos/flake.nix start=78
      mkNixosConfig =
        gpuProfile:
        nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
          inherit system;
          specialArgs = {
            inherit inputs username host;
            inherit profile;
          };
          modules = [
            (
              { ... }:
              {
                nixpkgs.config = {
                  allowUnfree = true;
                };
              }
            )
            ./modules/nix-caches.nix
            # had one for python that fails to build still
            # Saving this as template for future overlays
            ./modules/core/overlays.nix
            ./profiles/${gpuProfile}
            ./modules/home/suckless/dwm-session.nix
            inputs.catppuccin.nixosModules.catppuccin
            nix-flatpak.nixosModules.nix-flatpak
          ];
        };
```

Recommended direction: Introduce host into mkNixosConfig and build outputs for each host+profile pair. For example:
```nix path=null start=null
# inside outputs = inputs @ { nixpkgs, ... }:
let
  systems = [ "x86_64-linux" ];
  hosts = [ "ixas" "asus" "bubo" "ddubsos-vm" "default" "explorer" "macbook" "mini-intel" "pegasus" "prometheus" "xps15" ];
  profiles = [ "amd" "intel" "nvidia" "nvidia-laptop" "vm" ];

  mkNixosConfig = { system, host, profile }: nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
    inherit system;
    specialArgs = { inherit inputs username host profile; };
    modules = [
      ./modules/nix-caches.nix
      ./modules/core/overlays.nix
      ./profiles/${profile}
      ./hosts/${host}
      inputs.catppuccin.nixosModules.catppuccin
      nix-flatpak.nixosModules.nix-flatpak
    ];
  };
in {
  nixosConfigurations =
    nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs hosts (host:
      mkNixosConfig { system = "x86_64-linux"; inherit host; profile = "amd"; }
    );
}
```
- This is illustrative; adapt to your desired cartesian product of hosts and profiles or define a mapping from host -> profile.
- Using ./hosts/${host} will pull in hosts/<host>/default.nix, which already imports hardware.nix and host-packages.nix.

## Overlays and inputs
- overlays.nix exposes selected inputs (hyprpanel, ags, quickshell, etc.) through pkgs — a good pattern that keeps modules consuming pkgs rather than inputs directly.
- nixpkgs is pinned to unstable; that’s fine for a desktop-oriented system. If you want more stability, consider tracking a stable release branch or pin per subsystem.
- catppuccin and stylix modules are included; ensure stylix is configured only in the appropriate module namespace (system vs home) to avoid conflicting option settings.

## State versions
- system.stateVersion = "25.05" and home.stateVersion = "25.05" are set. Excellent. Keep these pinned and only bump when you intentionally want updated defaults.

## Flatpak and packaging
- nix-flatpak module is imported in system; it’s a pragmatic choice for apps with heavy multimedia dependencies (OBS, etc.). Keep it — it reduces friction for proprietary codecs and GPU acceleration.
- pkgs/twin and other custom packages live under pkgs/: good. Consider a top-level overlay to expose all local packages via pkgs.local.<name> or similar naming to segregate local vs upstream.

## Formatting, linting, and CI
- Consider adding a formatter and pre-commit checks:
  - alejandra or nixfmt-rfc-style for Nix
  - treefmt-nix to orchestrate multiple formatters (Nix, JSON, Markdown)
- Add flake checks and optionally a CI job to run nix flake check and formatting on push.

Example additions:
```nix path=null start=null
# flake.nix (snippet)
outputs = inputs @ { self, nixpkgs, ... }:
let
  systems = [ "x86_64-linux" ];
  forAllSystems = f: nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs systems (system: f (import nixpkgs { inherit system; }));
in {
  formatter = forAllSystems (pkgs: pkgs.alejandra);
  checks = forAllSystems (pkgs: {
    formatting = pkgs.runCommand "formatting" { buildInputs = [ pkgs.alejandra ]; } ''
      alejandra --check .
      touch $out
    '';
  });
}
```

## Secrets management
- If you plan to store secrets (SSH keys, tokens) in the repo, consider sops-nix or agenix to keep them encrypted and declarative.

## Minor cleanups and suggestions
- nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true is enabled globally — that’s fine, but if you need finer control, consider per-package allowUnfreePredicate.
- Consider documenting the rebuild flow in README.md (you already have many great docs) with an example nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<host> if/when you parameterize host in flake.
- You already use nh module; that’s a good UX improvement over raw nix commands.

## Answer: Should modules/home use default.nix or home.nix?
- Your current default.nix is conventional and appropriate for a directory that aggregates many home modules.
- home.nix is equally valid but typically used when the HM config lives in a single top-level file (especially in standalone HM setups). Given your modular structure, default.nix is the clearer signal that it’s an index/aggregator.
- Recommendation: Keep default.nix as-is.

## High-value next steps
1) Refactor flake outputs to parameterize host (and possibly profile) so each nixosConfigurations.<host> uses its own hosts/<host> variables.
2) Add a formatter and a flake checks block; optionally wire up CI.
3) If you want to reduce duplicate builds, consider useGlobalPkgs = true for HM (trade-offs explained above).
4) If secrets are planned, integrate sops-nix or agenix.

## Appendix: quick references
- Home Manager input follows nixpkgs along with other inputs: see flake.nix lines 16–25.
- HM as NixOS module in modules/core/user.nix with users.${username}.imports pulling modules/home.
- System and home stateVersion pinned to 25.05.
